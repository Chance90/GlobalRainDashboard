How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

In order to create programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable, you need to have a consistent code style and a modular approach that can be easily adapted to other programs. The CRUD module was created with adaptability and abstraction in mind, making it easy to use on any database in the future.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

During my time at SNHU, I've learned that taking my time and really studying the information beforehand is one of the most important steps in thinking like a computer scientist. I approached the Grazioso Salvare project the same way I've approached many other projects in the past. This includes understanding the requirements and thorough planning before getting started, but also having the ability to adapt and research problems that I'm struggling with. When creating databases in the future I will make sure to properly communicate with the client to ensure they are getting the functionality that they want out of their databases.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists solve problems and simplify workloads. This is important for many different reasons, but it's primarily important because it frees up other people who are working on the projects to focus the issues that matter to them without the headache of all the minutia.
